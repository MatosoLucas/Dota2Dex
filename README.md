## Personal Considerations
The final version of the application was deployed to vercel and can be found [here](https://vercel.com/matosolucas/dota2-dex)

It's a simple responsive project that should work both on desktop and mobile.

Right now I'm using the [OpenDota](https://docs.opendota.com/) API and this is what I thought of doing with it.

Feel free to suggest improvements, new features and fixes. (or a better way of doing things)

Maybe in the future I'll fetch my data directly from the steam API and that may give me some ideas for new features
